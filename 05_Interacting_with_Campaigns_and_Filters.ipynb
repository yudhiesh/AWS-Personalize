    "This is a good time to revisit the **hyperparameters** of the Personalize recipes. The SIMS recipe has a `popularity_discount_factor` hyperparameter (see [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/native-recipe-sims.html)). Leveraging this hyperparameter allows you to control the nuance you see in the results. This parameter and its behavior will be unique to every dataset you encounter, and depends on the goals of the business. You can iterate on the value of this hyperparameter until you are satisfied with the results, or you can start by leveraging Personalize's hyperparameter optimization (HPO) feature. For more information on hyperparameters and HPO tuning, see the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/customizing-solution-config-hpo.html)."

    "## Real-Time Event Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond generating static recommendations on-demand for each user, Personalize has the ability to **listen to events** from your application and **update recommendations** shown to users in near-real-time. In this example we'll focus on injecting **interaction events** (i.e. new clicks/reviews/purchases as a customer move around the site) - but as detailed in the [incremental dataset import documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/incremental-data-updates.html) there are also APIs available for updating user and item metadata, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already created an **event tracker** in the last notebook and kept a record of the `tracking_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this tracking ID, we're able to set up a utility function below that will **log a new interaction** via the **Personalize Events API**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Personalize, user activity is grouped into **sessions**, so we'll just use a simple logic here which creates a new random session ID the first time each `user_id` is used. In real applications, the website's existing session ID system might be used instead.\n",
    "- In an ideal world we will give **not just positive feedback** (interaction events), but also tell the model **what didn't work** by providing `impression` or `recommendation ID` feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information about feedback in the [Recording Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-events.html) section of the documentation."
